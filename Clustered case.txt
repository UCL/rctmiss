What I've done for clustered cases

All PMM methods:  
\item use new small-sample correction (n-1)/(n-p*) * (c/(c-1)
\item dof = ceff-1

meanscore: 
\item replace matrix C with a clustered version
\item compute effective #clusters (ceff) as 1 per fully/partly obs cluster and w_eff per systematically missing cluster

Two regressions:
\item compute ceff from a new equality using small-sample corerctions c/(c-1)
\item compute neff following from this
\item Note this gets neff=nobs, ceff=cobs under MAR
\note but it doesn't agree with standard with cobs=nobs
