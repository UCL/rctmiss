PROBLEMS TO FIX FOR RCTMISS.ADO
===============================

Miland Joshi, 29aug2013: on a trial where the control arm variable had the values ‘1’ (labelled “Control”) and ‘2’ (labelled “Intervention”), when I ran the program the graph legend (whether I allowed 1 line or 3) seemed to use “0” for the Intervention arm, even though 0 isn’t in the data itself.

- SM: noconstant drops the constant from the missingness model too - is this what we want?

- Alho option? e.g. attempts(varname)

- Can it be made to work for -nbreg-? (for Nick Horton)

20may2015 (Nexit):
    fails if arm Z has missing values
    slow with many excluded values
